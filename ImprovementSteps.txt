1. Enhanced Layout Controls

    Dynamic “Repel/Attract” Sliders
    Let the user fine-tune the CoSE “idealEdgeLength” and “nodeSpacing” on the fly via range inputs, so they can quickly de-juggle crowded layouts without manually editing the code.

    Preset Layout Profiles
    Offer buttons like “Tight”, “Balanced”, “Spacious” that swap in different layout parameters (e.g. low vs. high spacing), so users don’t have to pick numbers.

2. Richer Node & Edge Styling

    Hover Tooltips
    Show full email metadata (timestamp, full subject, maybe a snippet of body) on hover, rather than only on analysis.

    Color‐Coding by Domain
    Assign each node a background hue based on its email domain (e.g. @enron.com, @gmail.com), making clusters immediately visible.

    Edge Thickness / Opacity
    Thicker or more opaque edges for more frequent communication or more recent timestamps—gives visual weight to “important” relationships.

3. Interactive Filtering & Search

    Date Slider
    A time‐range slider to only render emails sent within a certain window (e.g. Jan 10–12, 2001). This instantly declutters the graph for temporal analysis.

    Email Search Box
    A text input to highlight or isolate nodes whose email addresses or subject lines match a keyword.

4. Contextual Side‐Panel

Instead of dumping analysis into a <pre> block at the bottom, open a right‐hand panel that:

    Lists selected node details in a neat card format

    Shows the analysis response in a scrollable, nicely formatted text area

    Offers buttons like “Copy Prompt” or “View Raw JSON”

5. Multi-Node & Thread Analysis

    More than Two Nodes
    Allow selecting any number of nodes (Ctrl+Click to multi-select) and run a group analysis prompt describing the subgraph’s overall pattern.

    Thread Detection
    Detect “threads” (chains of back-and-forth emails) automatically, and let the user click a thread to isolate or analyze it as a unit.

6. Prompt Template Tuning

    System Messages & Few-Shot Examples
    Prepend a short “system” message instructing the LLM how to interpret email graphs, or include one or two mini-examples in the prompt to guide its style.

    Parameter Controls
    Expose a dropdown for choosing “concise”, “detailed”, or “technical” analysis, which adjusts the prompt accordingly.

7. Performance & Scaling

    Pagination / Lazy Loading
    When the dataset grows, don’t fetch every node/edge at once. Load only the visible subgraph or the first N emails, then fetch more on demand.

    WebSocket Updates
    For live ingest (e.g. streaming new emails), use a WebSocket connection so the frontend can dynamically add new nodes/edges without full reload.

8. Aesthetic Polish

    Dark/Light Mode Toggle
    Let users switch between your current dark theme and a lighter variant.

    Smooth Transitions
    Animate layout changes and node selections with subtle transitions (Cytoscape supports animated layouts).

    Consistent Typography
    Use a web-safe or Google-hosted font (e.g. Inter or Roboto) and standardize font sizes for headers, labels, body text.

9. Testing & CI

    Visual Regression Tests
    Snapshots of the rendered graph for a known dataset to catch styling regressions.

    API Endpoint Coverage
    Add unit tests for /api/graph, /api/ask, and the email loader script to ensure stability as you iterate.

Next Steps

    Pick 2–3 of these improvements (e.g. hover tooltips, date slider, and side-panel) and prototype in the frontend.

    Iterate on the prompt templates with a “system” message and few-shot examples.

    Add basic unit tests and configure a GitHub Actions workflow to run them on each push.

Focusing on these refinements will give you a tight, user-friendly core experience—ready for richer data and more advanced features down the road.
